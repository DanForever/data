Description: Recorded during separate sessions, executive producer Ilya Salkind and producer Pierre Spengler are certainly proud of the film, even when touching, ever so briefly, on their clashes with director Richard Donner. While not for everyone, their commentary is all business -- budgets, profits, publicity, power players, key decisions, successes, failures, broken records, legacies, career-defining moments, production disagreements, industry anecdotes, releases dates and the like -- and all the better for it. Ego runs rampant at times, sure, but it only makes their discussion that much more entertaining.

Description: Also of interest is this 1951 theatrical feature film starring George Reeves as Clark Kent, Phyllis Coates as Lois Lane and Jeff Corey as Luke Benson, a short-sighted man who incites an angry mob into attacking a race of creatures who emerge from the mouth of an oil well. The film preceded the 1952 Adventures of Superman television series and introduced the world to Reeves' Superman.
