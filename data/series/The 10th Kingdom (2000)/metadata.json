  "Plot": "Two centuries after Snow White (Camryn Manheim) and Cinderella (Ann-Margret) had their adventures, the Nine Kingdoms ready themselves for the coronation of Prince Wendell (Daniel Lapaine), Snow White\u0027s grandson, to the throne of the Fourth Kingdom. But an evil once-Queen (Dianne Wiest) has freed herself from prison, and turns the Prince into a golden retriever. Wendell, by means of a magic mirror, escapes into a hitherto-unknown Tenth Kingdom (modern day New York City) and meets Virginia Lewis (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) and her father Tony Lewis (John Larroquette). Pursued by trolls, cops, and a wolf in man\u0027s form (Scott Cohen), the three blunder back into the Nine Kingdoms and begin their adventures to restore Wendell to his human form and throne, and find the magic mirror that will take Tony and Virginia back home, all the while unknowing that Virginia already has a connection to the Nine Kingdoms that may prove to be deadly before we reach Happily Ever After.",
