  "Plot": "Country Music will chronicle the history of a uniquely American art form, rising from the experiences of remarkable people in distinctive regions of our nation. From southern Appalachia\u0027s songs of struggle, heartbreak and faith to the rollicking western swing of Texas, from California honky tonks to Nashville\u0027s Grand Ole Opry, we will follow the evolution of country music over the course of the twentieth century, as it eventually emerged to become America\u0027s music.",
