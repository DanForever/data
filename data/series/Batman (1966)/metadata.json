Racing to the scene of the crime in the jet-powered Batmobile, Batman and Robin must (with the help of their trusty utility-belts) thwart the efforts of a rogues gallery of flamboyant archvillains, including The Joker (Cesar Romero), The Penguin (Burgess Meredith), The Riddler (Frank Gorshin) and the Catwoman (Julie Newmar and Eartha Kitt).",
